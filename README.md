# *multilift*: liftover from multiple sequence alignments

`multilift` facilitates the liftover to 'reference-space' of data recorded for
mutliple related, variant, sequences by calculating or parsing a multiple
sequence alignment of their genomes. `multilift` provides an in-built GUI and
lightweight browser functionality to enable supervision of this process or can
be run at the command line to enable file liftover and visualisation in
popular genome browsers.
